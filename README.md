## Description of problem

This repository contain a brief report, and work artifacts used to build the report, that highlights the differences between customers who did and did not accept coupons in a dataset. To generate the report and work artifacts, my knowledge of plotting, statistical summaries, and visualization using Python was used.

## Final summary

The data reveals that certain demographic and behavioral characteristics are associated with higher coupon acceptance rates for carry-out establishments. Specifically:

1. Customers who frequently use carry-out services (more than once a month), are not accompanied by children, and are not widowed show a high acceptance rate of 76.8%.

2. Younger customers (under 30) who frequently use carry-out services have a strong acceptance rate of 72.6%.

3. The highest acceptance rate (78.7%) is observed among frequent users of inexpensive restaurants (more than 4 times a month) with lower incomes (less than $50K).

These findings suggest that frequency of carry-out use, age, income level, and certain lifestyle factors (not being widowed, not having children present) are significant predictors of coupon acceptance.

Next Steps:

1. Segmentation Strategy: Develop a customer segmentation strategy based on these findings. Focus marketing efforts on the identified high-acceptance groups.

2. Targeted Marketing: Create targeted marketing campaigns for each high-acceptance group, tailoring the message and offers to their specific characteristics and preferences.

3. Further Analysis:
   - Investigate why lower-income, frequent users of inexpensive restaurants have the highest acceptance rate. This could inform pricing strategies or the types of restaurants to partner with.
   - Explore the reasons behind the slightly lower acceptance rate for younger customers compared to the other two groups.

4. Coupon Customization: Design coupons that appeal specifically to each group. For example, family-friendly offers for those without children, or budget-friendly options for the lower-income segment.

5. Timing and Frequency: Analyze the optimal timing and frequency of coupon distribution for each group to maximize acceptance rates.

6. Mobile App Development: Consider developing or enhancing a mobile app that caters to frequent carry-out users, making it easier for them to access and use coupons.

7. Partnership Expansion: Seek partnerships with a diverse range of carry-out and inexpensive restaurant options to cater to the preferences of the high-acceptance groups.

8. Customer Feedback: Conduct surveys or focus groups with members of these high-acceptance segments to gain deeper insights into their preferences and motivations.

9. ROI Analysis: Perform a return on investment analysis for coupon campaigns targeted at these specific groups versus broader, non-targeted campaigns.

10. Longitudinal Study: Implement a long-term study to track how these acceptance rates change over time and in response to different economic conditions or seasonal factors.

By focusing on these high-acceptance groups and implementing targeted strategies, we can potentially increase the overall effectiveness of our coupon program and drive higher engagement and sales for carry-out establishments.
